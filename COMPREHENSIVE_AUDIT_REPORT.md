### 5. **Weak File Extension Detection** ❌ → ✅

**Issues Found:**
- **Lines 87-89, 181-183**: Simple string matching for extensions instead of MIME type validation
- **Lines 461-463**: PDF rename function used basic string manipulation
- **Lines 35, 119**: Word processing had no proper extension handling

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive MIME type validation
- ✅ Added fallback extension-based validation
- ✅ Created `normalizeFileName()` and `ensureFileExtension()` utilities
- ✅ Implemented proper file type detection and validation
- ✅ Added support for multiple file formats and extensions

### 6. **Missing Metadata Preservation** ❌ → ✅

**Issues Found:**
- **Lines 42-95**: Word→PDF conversion lost all formatting and metadata
- **Lines 98-186**: PDF→Word conversion lost page structure and formatting
- **Lines 156-184**: PDF merge didn't preserve original metadata
- **Lines 35, 119**: Word processing had no metadata handling

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Implemented metadata preservation in all PDF operations
- ✅ Added proper title, producer, and creation date handling
- ✅ Implemented XMP metadata support for better compatibility
